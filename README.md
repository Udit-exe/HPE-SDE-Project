### Project Description: Hewlett Packard Enterprise Software Engineering Job Simulation - June 2024

During my participation in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Software Engineering Job Simulation on Forage in June 2024, I undertook the following tasks and successfully completed the project with the following outcomes:

#### Project Objective
The primary objective of this project was to design, develop, and test a RESTful web service that efficiently manages a list of employees, leveraging the Java Spring Boot framework.

#### Key Tasks and Deliverables

1. **Proposal Development for RESTful Web Service**
   - **Task:** Crafted a comprehensive proposal outlining the architecture and functionality of a RESTful web service dedicated to employee management.
   - **Details:** The proposal included detailed descriptions of endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee records, data validation strategies, error handling mechanisms, and security considerations.

2. **Development of Java Spring Boot Web Server Application**
   - **Task:** Built a robust web server application using Java Spring Boot.
   - **Details:** 
     - **HTTP Request Handling:** Implemented endpoints to handle various HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for managing employee data.
     - **JSON Data Support:** Enabled the web server to accept and process JSON data for employee records, ensuring seamless data interchange.
     - **Entity Management:** Designed the Employee entity class and corresponding repository to manage the data lifecycle in the application.
     - **Controller Layer:** Developed controllers to map HTTP requests to appropriate service methods, ensuring clean and maintainable code.

3. **Unit Testing and Performance Assessment**
   - **Task:** Developed and executed a comprehensive suite of unit tests to evaluate the performance and reliability of the Java Spring Boot application.
   - **Details:**
     - **Test Coverage:** Ensured extensive test coverage for all major functionalities, including CRUD operations and error handling.
     - **Performance Metrics:** Assessed application performance based on response times, accuracy of data handling, and robustness under various scenarios.
     - **Tools Used:** Leveraged JUnit and Mockito for writing and running tests, ensuring thorough validation of the application.

#### Technologies and Tools Utilized
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Framework:** Spring Boot
- **Testing Frameworks:** JUnit, Mockito
- **Data Format:** JSON
- **Development Tools:** IntelliJ IDEA, Maven
- **Version Control:** Git

#### Outcomes and Learning
This project provided a practical experience in building a complete RESTful web service from scratch using Java Spring Boot. It enhanced my skills in backend development, HTTP request handling, JSON data processing, and unit testing. The successful completion of this project demonstrated my ability to deliver robust and maintainable code, adhering to best practices in software engineering.

This experience with Hewlett Packard Enterprise's simulation program has prepared me well for real-world software engineering challenges, particularly in developing and maintaining RESTful services in Java Spring Boot.
